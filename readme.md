My first (actual) day on github
Some keyword that I should remember:

MARKDOWN is a very popular method to format text

Markdown doesn't require closing tags (unlike HTML)
Markdown means that formatting signs can be interpreteted universally

# Standard Heading, h1

## H2


> Identation like you can see in mail threads
